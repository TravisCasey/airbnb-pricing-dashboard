# Airbnb NYC Pricing Dashboard
This project adapts messy and incomplete [data about Airbnb properties in NYC](Airbnb_Open_Data.csv) sourced from Kaggle into a [dashboard](AirbnbProject.xlsx) displaying review and pricing info with various slices. 

## Purpose
The intention of this dashboard is to identify ideal pricing ranges for properties based on location, type, and construction year. We use the total number of reviews and average monthly reviews as indicators of successful Airbnb properties, and display the total number of properties in each price range with the selected filters. This can help to identify niches and align your current property with the market price. Alternatively, somebody looking to invest in a property can identify a niche in the data and look to purchase a property that could be priced in that range.

## Procedure
The data was sourced from Kaggle and loaded into Microsoft Excel for cleaning and visualization. The raw data can be found in the second tab of the dashboard. First, the key data columns were identified, and subdivided into categories as needed for better visualization (particularly categorized by rental price and construction year). Data entries were standardized in the columns, fixing typos, capitalizations, and different wordings. Then record with empty entries in the key columns were eliminated as they could not be used for our visualization. The cleaned data may be viewed in the third tab of the dashboard. 

This being done, the key data was organized into pivot tables and charts made. This is on the fourth tab of the dashboard. Finally, the charts and relevant slices are added to a dashboard for easy perusing of the trends.
